### Description

faiNumber is a fast and secure numerical library that is being built
for a variety of programming languages.

faiNumber mainly deals with converting numerical data into string type
representation(or char array) to a value of an integer data type,
and vice versa(where available).

faiNumber also offers features for checking if a string is a valid integer
of a variety of numbering systems. This feature may not be available for all
of faiNumber version.

One of faiNumber's unique features is that faiNumber can compare numerical
strings of a numbering system with the radix from 2 to 36 without length constraint.
faiNumber may not support this feature on all languages.

Flexibility was never a part of the design when faiNumber was first released
for Java. Nonetheless, since the first release of Fortran,
flexibility is now part of the design for faiNumber.
