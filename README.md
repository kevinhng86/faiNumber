### Description

faiNumber is a fast and secured numerical library that is being built
for a variety of programming language.

faiNumber mainly deals with converting numerical data in type string
representation(or char array) to a value of an integer data type,
and vice versa(where available).

faiNumber also offers features for checking if strings is a valid integer
of a variety of numbering system.

One of faiNumber's unique features is that faiNumber can compare numerical
strings of numbering system from 2 to 36 without length constraint.

Flexibility was never a part of the design when faiNumber was first released
for Java. Nonetheless, since the first release for Fortran,
flexibility is now part of the design for faiNumber.
